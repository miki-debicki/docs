## Dynamic Server Deployments

For enterprise use cases, you can create server deployments programmatically via the API with your own credentials.

This is useful for:
- Using your own OAuth app credentials
- Compliance with enterprise security policies
- Managing credentials in your own infrastructure

See the [Server Deployment API](/api/server-deployment) for details.

## BYO OAuth

Use your own OAuth app credentials:

1. Register your OAuth app with the service (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
2. Create a server deployment via the API with your OAuth credentials
3. Use the deployment like normal

This allows you to:
- Control branding in OAuth consent screens
- Use your company's existing OAuth apps
- Manage OAuth credentials independently
