</Note>

Need full control over OAuth apps and API keys for compliance, branding, or security? Metorial lets you create server deployments dynamically via the API using your own credentials—no dashboard required.

## Why BYO?

Using your own credentials gives you full control over how your users authenticate and how your infrastructure handles sensitive data. Enterprise teams choose BYO for three main reasons:

<Info>
**Compliance & Security:**
- Keep credentials in your own infrastructure
- Meet data residency requirements
- Audit and rotate credentials on your schedule
</Info>

<Info>
**Branding & Control:**
- OAuth consent screens show your company name
- Use your company's existing OAuth apps
- Control which permissions are requested
</Info>

<Info>
**Multi-tenancy:**
- Create isolated deployments per customer
- Different credentials for different organizations
- Scale deployment creation programmatically
</Info>

## Dynamic Server Deployments

Create server deployments programmatically via the Metorial API instead of using the dashboard.

**The flow:**
1. Call the API with your credentials to create a deployment
2. Receive a deployment ID
3. Use the deployment ID in your SDK like any other integration

Ideal for multi-tenant applications where each customer needs isolated credentials, or enterprises managing multiple OAuth apps across teams.

See the [Metorial API documentation](/api-getting-started) for endpoint details, authentication, and request/response schemas.

## BYO OAuth Apps

Use your own OAuth app credentials instead of Metorial's default OAuth apps.

**Setup process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register OAuth App">
    Register your OAuth app with the service (GitHub, Slack, Google, etc.). Save your client ID and client secret.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Deployment via API">
    Call the Metorial API or use the Dashboard to create a server deployment, passing your OAuth app credentials in the request body.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Deployment">
    Use the returned deployment ID in your SDK code like any other deployment. Users will see your OAuth app name when authorizing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Benefits:**
- Consent screens show your company name and branding
- Full control over scopes and permissions
- Integrate with existing identity systems
- Credentials stay in your infrastructure
</Info>

## BYO API Keys

Use your own API keys for integrations like Exa, Brave, or Tavily.

<Info>
**Use cases:**
- Isolate usage per customer or team
- Track costs per deployment
- Rotate keys without affecting other deployments
</Info>

Create deployments via the API with your keys—Metorial uses them when tools are called.
