## What Are Integrations?

Integrations are pre-built MCP servers that provide ready-to-use tools for popular services. Instead of building API clients from scratch, you can deploy integrations for services like GitHub, Slack, Google Calendar, Exa, and more.

Each integration exposes tools that your AI models can call directly. For example, the GitHub integration provides tools for creating issues, reviewing pull requests, and managing repositories—all without writing any integration code yourself.

## Licensing

Metorial uses the **FSL (Functional Source License)** - source-available with commercial licensing for production.

**What this means for developers:**
- **Free during development**: Build and test without restrictions
- **Source available**: Audit the code for security and compliance
- **Production requires a license**: Contact us when you're ready to deploy

## Deployment Options

### Cloud SaaS (Recommended)

Start building immediately with Metorial's hosted cloud at [app.metorial.com](https://app.metorial.com). No infrastructure setup required—just create an account and deploy integrations.

<Info>
**Ideal for**: Teams who want to focus on building AI features rather than managing infrastructure.
</Info>

### Enterprise On-Premises

Self-host Metorial in your own cloud environment when you need full control over data and infrastructure. Metorial runs on **HashiStack** (Nomad, Vault, Consul) and deploys to AWS, GCP, Azure, or your private cloud.

<Info>
**Ideal for**: Enterprises with strict data residency requirements or compliance needs.

## Authentication Types

Integrations use two authentication patterns depending on whether they access shared services or user-specific data.

### API Key Integrations

Best for services where one API key serves your entire application. The integration uses your credentials to make requests on behalf of your app.

<Info>
**Examples**: Exa (search), Tavily (search), Brave (search)

**When to use**: Single-tenant applications, internal tools, or services that don't have user-specific data.

**Setup**: Get an API key from the service, create a deployment in Metorial, and paste your key. Done.
</Info>

### OAuth Integrations

Required when each user needs to authorize access to their own account. The integration acts on behalf of individual users with their explicit permission.

<Info>
**Examples**: Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar, Gmail

**When to use**: Multi-tenant applications where users connect their personal accounts.

**How it works**: Users authorize via OAuth, you store their session ID, and pass it when creating MCP sessions. Each user's data stays isolated.
</Info>

See [OAuth Integrations](integrations-oauth) for implementation patterns.

## Choosing Integrations

You can mix both authentication types in the same application. For example, use an API key integration for search (Exa) while using OAuth integrations for user-specific services (Slack, GitHub). When creating MCP sessions, pass multiple deployments together—Metorial combines all their tools into a single tool list for your AI model.

<Info>
**Single-user applications**: API key integrations work well.

**Multi-user applications**: Use OAuth integrations for user-specific access.

**Enterprise**: Consider BYO OAuth apps with dynamic server deployments.
