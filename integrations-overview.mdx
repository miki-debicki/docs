## What Are Integrations?

Integrations are pre-built MCP servers that provide ready-to-use tools for various services like GitHub, Slack, Google Calendar, Exa, and more.

## Licensing

Metorial is licensed under the **FSL (Functional Source License)**. This means:

- **Source available**: You can view and audit the code
- **Free for evaluation and development**
- **Commercial use** requires a license for production deployments

## Deployment Options

### Cloud SaaS

Use Metorial's hosted cloud service at [app.metorial.com](https://app.metorial.com):
- No infrastructure to manage
- Automatic updates and scaling
- Quick setup

### Enterprise On-Premises

For enterprises requiring on-premises deployment:
- Deploy on **AWS**, **GCP**, or other cloud providers
- Uses **HashiStack** (Nomad, Vault, Consul) for orchestration
- Full control over infrastructure and data
- Contact us for enterprise licensing

## Authentication Types

### API Key Integrations

Simpler setup - just provide your API credentials.

**Examples**: Exa, Tavily

**Setup**:
1. Get API key from the service
2. Create deployment in Metorial
3. Paste API key in configuration

### OAuth Integrations

User authorization required - each user authorizes access.

**Examples**: Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar

**Common patterns**:
- **One-time authorization**: User authorizes once, you store and reuse the session
- **Enterprise BYO**: Bring your own OAuth app credentials
- **OAuth export/import**: Reduce friction by importing existing tokens

See [OAuth Integrations](/integrations-oauth) for detailed patterns.

## Choosing Integrations

**Single-user applications**: API key integrations work well.

**Multi-user applications**: Use OAuth integrations for user-specific access.

**Enterprise**: Consider BYO OAuth apps with dynamic server deployments.
