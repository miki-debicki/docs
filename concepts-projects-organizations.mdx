<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- How organizations and projects are structured
- How to organize your deployments
</Note>

## Understanding the Hierarchy

Metorial uses a hierarchy to organize your work:

```
Organization
└── Project(s)
    └── Instance(s)
        └── Server Deployments
        └── API Keys
        └── OAuth Sessions
```

### Organizations

An **organization** is your top-level workspace - typically representing your company, team, or personal account.

### Projects

A **project** is a container for related work - typically representing an application or product.

### Instances

An **instance** represents an environment within a project (e.g., Development, Production).

## Creating Your Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="First-Time Setup">
    When you sign up, you'll create your first organization and project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Projects">
    Create additional projects for different applications.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Different API Keys

Projects and Instances are isolated - use different API keys for different projects:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Project A
let metorialA = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_PROJECT_A_KEY
});

// Project B
let metorialB = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_PROJECT_B_KEY
});
```

```python Python
import os
from metorial import Metorial

# Project A
metorial_a = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_PROJECT_A_KEY"))

# Project B
metorial_b = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_PROJECT_B_KEY"))
```
</CodeGroup>
