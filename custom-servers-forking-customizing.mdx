<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- How to edit forked code
- Adding new tools
- Testing changes
</Note>

Edit your forked server's code to customize tools, add new functionality, or integrate with your systems. Changes are deployed as a managed server.

## Editing Forked Code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Editor">
    Open the code editor from your forked server's dashboard or simply make the changes in your repository and push them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Files">
    Modify any file with syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Changes save automatically as you edit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Test your changes in the editor before deploying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Tools

Define new tools by adding tool definitions and handler functions to your forked code. Tools follow the MCP specification with a schema defining inputs and a function implementing the logic.

<Info>
**Tool Structure:**
- Schema: Defines tool inputs and outputs
- Handler: Implements the tool logic
- Registration: Adds tool to your server
</Info>

Modify existing tools by editing their handler functions or input schemas.
