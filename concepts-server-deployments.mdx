# Server Deployments

Server deployments are the core building blocks of Metorial. They define which integrations and tools your AI applications can access.

<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- What server deployments are and how they work
- The difference between servers and deployments
- How to use deployments in your applications

</Note>

## Understanding the Concepts

### MCP Servers vs Deployments

**MCP Server**: A template or blueprint for an integration (e.g., "GitHub Integration", "Slack Bot", "Exa Search").

**Server Deployment**: A configured, ready-to-use instance of a server with your specific credentials and settings.

Think of it like this:
- **Server** = Recipe
- **Deployment** = Cooked meal with your ingredients

### Why Deployments?

Deployments allow you to:

- **Configure once, use everywhere**: Set up credentials once and reuse across your applications
- **Manage multiple instances**: Create separate deployments for dev and production
- **Control access**: Different API keys and OAuth sessions per deployment

## Types of Deployments

### Integration Deployments

Deploy pre-built servers from the Metorial catalog.

**Configuration types**:
- **API Key-based**: Provide your API credentials (Exa, Tavily)
- **OAuth-based**: Users authorize access (Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar)

### Custom Server Deployments

Deploy your own MCP server code:

- **Managed**: Metorial hosts and runs your code
- **External**: Connect your self-hosted server
- **Forked**: Clone and modify an existing server

## Deployment IDs

Every deployment has a unique ID. You'll use this ID when:
- Creating sessions with the SDK
- Making API calls

**Finding your deployment ID**: Go to the deployment details page and copy the ID.

## Using Deployments in Code

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
await metorial.withProviderSession(
    provider,
    { serverDeployments: [{ serverDeploymentId: 'your-deployment-id' }] },
    async ({ tools, closeSession }) => {
        // Use tools
        await closeSession();
    }
);
```

```python Python
async def session_handler(session):
    # Use session["tools"] and session["callTools"]
    pass

await metorial.with_provider_session(
    MetorialAnthropic,
    [{"serverDeploymentId": "your-deployment-id"}],
    session_handler
)
```
