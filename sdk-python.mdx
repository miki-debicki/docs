<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- How to install the Metorial Python SDK
- How to make requests to the Metorial API using the SDK

**Before you start:**
- [Create your API Keys](/api-getting-started)

**External resources:**
- [Python SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/metorial/metorial/tree/main/clients/metorial-py)
</Note>

The Metorial Python SDK provides a Pythonic interface for interacting with the Metorial API. Use it to manage deployments, create sessions, handle OAuth flows, and integrate MCP tools into your Python applications.

The SDK is fully typed with type hints for all methods and resources, making it ideal for use with modern Python development tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the SDK using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install metorial
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using the SDK">
    To use the SDK, import the `Metorial` class and create an instance with your API key:

    ```python
    from metorial import Metorial

    metorial = Metorial(
      api_key="$$SECRET_TOKEN$$"
    )
    ```

    You can now use the `metorial` instance to make requests to the Metorial API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making Requests">
    The SDK organizes API resources into logical attributes (like `servers`, `server_implementations`, `oauth`, etc.). Each resource provides methods for common operations like `get()`, `list()`, `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()`.

    ```python
    # Get a server by ID
    server = metorial.servers.get('srv_Rm4Mnheq2bfEPhBhP7SY')

    # Update a server instance
    result = metorial.server_implementations.update('svi_Rm4Mnheq2bfEPhBhP7SY', {
      "name": "updated name",
      "description": "updated description"
    })
    ```

    All methods are synchronous by default. For async operations, use the async version of the SDK (see the GitHub repository for examples).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using Types">
    The SDK includes type hints for all API resources. Use tools like mypy or your IDE's type checker to catch errors before runtime and get autocomplete suggestions for all API methods and parameters.
  </Step>
