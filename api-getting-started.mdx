## What is the Metorial API?

The Metorial API is a simple, user-friendly way to interact with Metorial's services. It uses standard web communication (REST) and always returns data in JSON format, making it easy to work with across different programming languages.

## Before You Begin: Getting Your API Key

To use the Metorial API, you'll need an API key. You can generate these in two types:

**Publishable API Keys** (`metorial_pk_`):

- Used for public data access
- Safe to use in client-side code
- Starts with `metorial_pk_`

**Secret API Keys** (`metorial_sk_`):

- Provides full project access
- Must be kept private
- Starts with `metorial_sk_`

## Making Your First API Request

When making a request, you'll always use this base URL:

```
https://api.metorial.com
```

To authenticate, include your API key in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer metorial_pk_abc123
```

To get started, let's make a simple request to fetch a list of threads:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.metorial.com/secrets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer metorial_pk_abc123"
```

## Important Things to Know

### Rate Limits

We have some basic usage limits to keep things fair:

- 1000 requests per IP every 10 seconds
- Development environments: 100 requests per 10 minutes
- Production environments: 5000 requests per 10 minutes

### Handling Responses

Our API uses standard HTTP response codes:

- `200`: Success!
- `400`: Something's wrong with your request
- `401`: Invalid API key
- `403`: Not enough permissions
- `404`: Can't find what you're looking for
- `429`: You've hit the rate limit

### Pagination

When fetching lists of items, we support pagination. Each response includes cursors to help you fetch more items easily.
