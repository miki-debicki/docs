- How to fork servers
- Customization
</Note>

Forking creates your own copy of an existing integration from the Metorial catalog. Start with a working server and customize the code to add features, modify behavior, or integrate with your systems.

## What is Forking?

Forking duplicates an integration's complete source code into your account. Your forked server is independent from the original and becomes a managed server that you control. Make any changes you want without affecting the original integration.

<Info>
**Benefits of Forking:**
- Start with a working implementation
- Customize to your specific needs
- No impact on the original integration
- Deploy as your own managed server
