## Testing an MCP server

MCP servers in Metorial provide tools, resources, and capabilities to AI assistants. In this guide, we will pick up on the server deployed in the last step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Server Page">
    We start at the end of the last guide. Navigate to the overview page for your deployed GitHub MCP server.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Explorer">
    Click the **Open Explorer** button to open an interactive tool that lists all the MCP server's capabilities.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Server Capabilities">
    Select the **Repository Content** resource template from the available options. Enter the repository owner, repository name, and the file path you want to target. These settings define the list and method information that your AI integrations will invoke automatically.

  <Step title="View Result">
    View the resulting response from the MCP server to see the data your AI integrations will consume.

  <Step title="Explore Available Tool Calls">
    Navigate to the **Tools** section to browse available tool calls. Select the tool call you want to try out—here, it's the `fork_repository` call. With the GitHub MCP server and a properly scoped Personal Access Token, your AI integrations can invoke any of these calls.
