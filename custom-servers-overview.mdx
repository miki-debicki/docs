<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- The types of custom servers available
- When to use each type
</Note>

Beyond the pre-built integrations in the Metorial catalog, you can deploy your own custom MCP servers. Choose from three deployment options based on your requirements.

## Types of Custom Servers

### Managed Servers

Upload your MCP server code and Metorial hosts it for you. Your code runs in Metorial's infrastructure with automatic scaling and monitoring. Supported languages include TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js) and Python.

<Info>
**Best for:**
- Custom business logic and internal APIs
- Teams that want to focus on code rather than infrastructure
- Rapid prototyping and deployment
</Info>

### External Servers

Connect your self-hosted MCP server to Metorial. Your server runs on your own infrastructure and Metorial connects to it via HTTP/HTTPS. You maintain full control over hosting, security, and deployment.

<Info>
**Best for:**
- On-premises requirements
- Existing infrastructure you want to integrate
- Sensitive data that must stay in your environment
</Info>

### Forking

Clone and modify an existing integration from the catalog. Start with a working integration and customize it to your needs. The forked server becomes a managed server that you can deploy and update.

<Info>
**Best for:**
- Customizing existing integrations
- Adding features to catalog servers
- Learning from existing implementations
