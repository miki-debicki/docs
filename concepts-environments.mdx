# Development vs Production Environments

Metorial uses instances to separate your development and production environments, allowing you to test safely before deploying to production.

<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- The difference between development and production instances
- How to work across environments
- Best practices for environment management

</Note>

## Understanding Instances

An **instance** represents an isolated environment within your project. Each instance has its own:

- Server deployments
- API keys
- OAuth sessions
- Logs and metrics

Changes in one instance don't affect others, allowing you to test safely.

## Instance Types

### Development Instance

Your default workspace for building and testing.

**Characteristics**:
- Lower rate limits (100 requests per 10 minutes)
- Shorter log retention
- Free or low-cost testing
- Isolated from production

**Use for**:
- Writing and debugging code
- Testing new deployments
- Experimenting with integrations
- Training team members

### Production Instance

Your live environment for real users and applications.

**Characteristics**:
- Higher rate limits (5,000 requests per 10 minutes)
- Extended log retention
- Premium features enabled
- Optimized infrastructure

**Use for**:
- Live applications
- Real user traffic
- Business-critical operations
- SLA-backed services

## Working Across Environments

### Switching Instances

In the Metorial dashboard, use the instance dropdown in the navigation to switch between environments.

### Separate API Keys

Use different API keys for each instance:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Development
let devMetorial = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_DEV_KEY
});

// Production
let prodMetorial = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_PROD_KEY
});
```

```python Python
import os
from metorial import Metorial

# Development
dev_metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_DEV_KEY"))

# Production
prod_metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_PROD_KEY"))
```
</CodeGroup>

### Separate Deployments

Create matching deployments in each instance with appropriate credentials for that environment.

## Best Practices

**Never share credentials**: Use separate API keys and OAuth apps for each environment.

**Test before production**: Always test deployments in development before using in production.

**Access control**: Limit production access to necessary team members.
