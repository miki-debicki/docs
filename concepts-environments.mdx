## Understanding Instances

An **instance** represents an isolated environment within your project. Each instance has its own:

- Server deployments
- API keys
- OAuth sessions
- Logs and metrics

Changes in one instance don't affect others, allowing you to test in isolation.

## Instance Types

### Development Instance

Your default workspace for building and testing.

### Production Instance

Your live environment for real users and applications.

## Working Across Environments

### Switching Instances

In the Metorial dashboard, use the instance dropdown in the navigation to switch between environments.

### Separate API Keys

Use different API keys for each instance:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Development
let devMetorial = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_DEV_KEY
});

// Production
let prodMetorial = new Metorial({
    apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_PROD_KEY
});
```

```python Python
import os
from metorial import Metorial

# Development
dev_metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_DEV_KEY"))

# Production
prod_metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.getenv("METORIAL_PROD_KEY"))
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

**Never share credentials**: Use separate API keys and OAuth apps for each environment.

**Test before production**: Always test deployments in development before using in production.

**Access control**: Limit production access to necessary team members.
